    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Shibaprasad Bhattacharya" class="headshot" loading="lazy">
    <p>I believe analytics creates real value when it's tied to strategy and product decisions. That's where I like to work - where data actually drives what happens next.</p>
    <p>I do my best work on messy, ambiguous business problems. The kind where you're not sure what question to ask, let alone how to answer it. I've learned that framing the problem right is usually harder (and more important) than building the perfect model.</p>
    <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
    <p>My career has taken me through different industries: I started at Delhivery in Analytics & BI, then moved to Air India's Operations Tech team, and now I'm with the Drug Development team at Bristol Myers Squibb, working on projects that hopefully help patients.</p>
    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>When I'm not working with data, you can find me strength training, exploring the art of brewing coffee, and occasionally writing on my newsletter, where I share both technical explorations and personal reflections.</p>
