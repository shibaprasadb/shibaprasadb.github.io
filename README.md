# shibaprasadb.github.io

This repository hosts my personal website: [shibaprasadb.github.io](https://shibaprasadb.github.io).

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Structure

- `_layouts/default.html` – Base template that wraps each page and includes shared assets.
- `_includes/nav.html` – Navigation bar. Edit this file to update links across the site.
- `index.html` – Home page with a quick introduction and links.
- `blog.html` – Links to my Data Signal newsletter.
- `publications.html` – Selected research work.
- `about.html` – Professional journey and interests.
- `images/` – Icons and photographs used on the site.
- `style.css` – Global styling.

## Local development

Install Jekyll and run the development server:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to preview the site.
