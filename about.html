        <p><strong>Analytics creates real value when it is strategy- and product-driven.</strong> 
        I like to work at the intersection of these, where data meets decisions.</p>

        <p>I shine most when solving <strong>ambiguous business problems</strong> with data and first-principles thinking. 
        Over time, I’ve realized that the hardest and most important step isn’t always building the right model, but <em>asking the right questions</em>. 
        That’s where clarity, structure, and data-driven framing matter most—and where I thrive.</p>

        <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>I began my career at <strong>Delhivery</strong> with the Analytics & BI team, moved to <strong>Air India</strong> in the Operations Tech team, 
        and now work in the <strong>Drug Development team at Bristol Myers Squibb</strong>, contributing to projects that improve patients’ lives.</p>

        <h3>Beyond Work</h3>
        <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy <strong>strength training</strong>, 
        <strong>brewing coffee</strong>, and <strong>occasional blogging</strong> where I share both technical insights and personal reflections.</p>
