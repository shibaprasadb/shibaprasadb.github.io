# shibaprasadb.github.io

This repository hosts my personal website: [shibaprasadb.github.io](https://shibaprasadb.github.io).

The site is built with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

## Structure

- `content/pages/` – Markdown source for site pages.
- `pelicanconf.py` – Pelican configuration.
- `images/` – Icons and photographs used on the site.

## Local development

Install Pelican and build the site:

```bash
pip install pelican
pelican content
```

The generated site will be placed in the `output/` directory.
