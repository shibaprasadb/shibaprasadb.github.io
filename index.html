  <p>I work at the intersection of analytics and strategy, using AI, operations research, and machine learning to solve complex business problems.</p>

  <p>I translate vague challenges into structured questions, then deploy the right analytical tools to answer them. Because the hardest part isn't building the model - it's asking the right question.</p>

  <p>Currently working as <strong>Data Analyst II at Bristol Myers Squibb</strong>.</p>

  <p>I believe analytics creates real value when it's tied to strategy and product decisions. That's where I like to work &mdash; where data actually drives what happens next.</p>

  <p>I do my best work on messy, ambiguous business problems. The kind where you're not sure what question to ask, let alone how to answer it. I've learned that framing the problem right is usually harder (and more important) than building the perfect model.</p>

  <h3>Professional Journey</h3>

  <p>My career has taken me through different industries: I started at Delhivery in Analytics &amp; BI, then moved to Air India's Operations Tech team, and now I'm with the Drug Development team at Bristol Myers Squibb, working on projects that hopefully help patients.</p>

  <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
  <p>When I'm not working with data, you can find me strength training, exploring the art of brewing coffee, and occasionally writing on my newsletter, where I share both technical explorations and personal reflections.</p>
