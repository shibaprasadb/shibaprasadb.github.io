      <p>I work at the intersection of product, analytics, and strategy - using AI, operations research, and machine learning to solve complex business problems and drive product decisions.</p>
      <p>Currently at Bristol Myers Squibb, working on AI and analytics projects in drug development.</p>

    <p>I do my best work on messy, ambiguous business problems - the kind where you're not sure what question to ask, let alone how to answer it. Framing the problem right is usually harder (and more important) than building the perfect model.</p>

    <p>I believe analytics creates real value when it's tied to strategy and product decisions. I'm particularly interested in how data shapes product strategy - from feature prioritization to market expansion to user behavior analysis. That's where I like to work - where data actually drives what happens next.</p>

    <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
    <p>My career has taken me through different industries: I started at Delhivery in Analytics &amp; BI, then moved to Air India's Operations Tech team, and now I'm with the Drug Development team at Bristol Myers Squibb, working on projects that hopefully help patients.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>When I'm not working with data, you can find me strength training, exploring the art of brewing coffee, and occasionally writing on my newsletter, where I share both technical explorations and personal reflections.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Open to conversations about Product Analytics, Strategic Analytics, and Decision Sciences roles.</p>
