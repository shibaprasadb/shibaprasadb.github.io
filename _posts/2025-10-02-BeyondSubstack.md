title: Why I’m Cross-Posting Beyond Substack
---
I have been using Substack for some time now.  

I have two blog-newsletters: one where I write about [my reflections](https://ordinaryanalysis.substack.com/), and another that is [data-tech related](https://datasignal.substack.com/).  

As a platform to distribute your writings, Substack works really well. So, I will continue to publish my personal blog there (or if I like the new setup, then I might start here more regularly too).  

But for more technical content, Substack might not be the best platform.  

One thing is that it performs rather poorly on different platforms where you would like to share your work. Again, this is not Substack's fault, but it does a great disservice to the people sharing their work.  

Another is that owning your content is a great thing. On a personal website, you will be the one owning everything, and this can be used as a repository for all the work that you do.  
And let's face it, all Substack blogs, mostly, look the same. Personal websites, OTOH, reflect the author in a better way.  

Keeping this in mind, I will start sharing my tech-related explorations here, and maybe add a link or two for Substack.  

Let's see how it goes.  

I created this website with some vibe coding and through some LLM-driven (non-vibe-coding) help. My next post will be related to that. I enjoyed my first vibe coding explorations, but there are some pitfalls.

This is my first post on this site. Going forward, I’ll be using this space for my **technical explorations** — topics around data science, analytics, product thinking, and experiments with new tools and workflows.  

If you’d like to keep up with my more reflective, personal essays, you can subscribe to [Ordinary Analysis](https://ordinaryanalysis.substack.com/). For data-tech content in a newsletter format, you’ll still find me on [Data Signal](https://datasignal.substack.com/).  

Thanks for reading, and welcome!
